a) 
We choose to smooth the power spectrum using a convolution of the Fourier transform of the noise with a uniform distribution. Testing out different window functions (Blackman, Tukey, Flatened Cosine), we found that the one that giving the best signal-to-noise ratio values was the Tukey window function. To deal with thelines in the noise power spectrum, I tested out various smoothing proportions and I used the one which gave me the best smoothing to presence of lines. 

d) 
To calculate the analytical noise, I matched filtered the windowed template with itself. From there, I got the standard deviation of this new signal in order to get a value for the noise. I then got the height of the spike in the new signal, corresponding to the actual GW signal and divided this value with the standard deviation I found earlier. 
To calculate the signal-to-noise ratio from the scatter of the matched filter, I got a value for the height of the GW spike and got a value for the standard deviation of a part of the signal that did not contain the spike. I divided the height by the standard deviation to a value for the signal-to-noise ratio.
I found that my SNR values for the scatter method were consistently lower than the analytical values. This is due to the fact that when I calculate the standard deviation for the signal (without the spike), I do not get the standard deviation over the whole signal. Rather, I only get it for a part of the signal, which means I lose information in this process. This loss probably leads to the difference in scatter and analytical values of the SNR.
