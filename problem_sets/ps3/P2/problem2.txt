a)
We choose to use the scipy ODE solver for simplicity. We will set up the problem to be able as to use this solver.
b)
We know that the decay rate is  equal to ln(2)/T_1/2 where T_1/2 is the half-life.
As we can see in the UraniumToLeadRatio_CloserLook.pdf, we notice that there is the same proportion of uranium and lead around 4*10^9 years.
This is approximately the half-life of uranium, which makes sense since we expect half the uranium to have decayed into lead at that time.
The value is higher than the actual half-life because the intermediary products slightly increase the time it takes for uranium to decay even though their half-life is only a fraction of U_238s.
